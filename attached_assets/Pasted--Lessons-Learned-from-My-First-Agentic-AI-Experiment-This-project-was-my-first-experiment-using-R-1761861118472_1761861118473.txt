🧠 Lessons Learned from My First Agentic AI Experiment

This project was my first experiment using Replit and Agentic AI, aimed at building an A2A (Agent-to-Agent) system for aligning resumes with job postings. Here are the key takeaways from the journey:

1. Start Simple — Multi-Agent Systems Are Hard

Building multiple agents from the start was much harder than expected. While creating the UI was straightforward, the A2A flow for parsing and aligning resumes quickly became complex.
If I were to do it again, I’d start by perfecting each agent individually:

First, the resume reader

Then, the resume extractor

Then, the company info extractor
Only after perfecting those would I layer in multi-agent orchestration.

2. Less Abstraction, More Control

Using higher-level frameworks was convenient at first, but I now see the value of less abstraction. Dropping down a level (e.g., using something like LangChain or even custom orchestration) gave me control over how agents actually communicate and share context.

3. Prompt Engineering Is Everything

After reviewing the AI-generated content, I realized how much results depend on prompt design. A small change in phrasing or instruction structure can drastically improve coherence, formatting, and factual accuracy.

4. Pay for OpenAI Credits 😅

Self-explanatory, but worth noting — limited access = limited debugging ability. Without sufficient tokens, it’s hard to test complex agent interactions.

5. State and Memory Management Are Crucial

Multi-agent systems break easily without a clear shared memory or context handoff. Each agent must “know what’s already been decided.” Even a lightweight state layer (Redis, local dict, or context object) helps maintain continuity.

6. Orchestration Is the Real Product

The “glue” — sequencing, error handling, and feedback loops — matters more than the agents themselves. Success comes from building a reliable orchestrator, not just smart subagents.

7. Evaluation and Ground Truth Matter

It’s difficult to tell if an agent actually succeeded without metrics. Future iterations should have structured benchmarks (e.g., comparing extracted skills to ground truth) before spending more time on prompt tuning.

8. Cost and Context Optimization

Combining resumes, job descriptions, and reasoning prompts quickly blows up token counts. Smaller, modular prompts and cached embeddings would make this cheaper and faster.

9. UI ≠ Workflow

Designing the UI first exposed a sync problem — the backend logic and agent flow need to be stable before connecting to the front end. Next time, I’d mock agent outputs before wiring real API calls.

10. Privacy and Data Handling

Since this involves personal resumes and job data, it’s important to build with data privacy and local storage in mind. Logs and caches can unintentionally expose sensitive user info if not managed carefully.

11. Reliability > Intelligence

Ultimately, the first goal isn’t to make the smartest agent — it’s to make the most dependable one. Perfecting one agent’s understanding before chaining many is the real foundation for autonomous AI systems.
